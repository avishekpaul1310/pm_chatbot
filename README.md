## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Q: The chatbot doesn't understand my question**  
A: Try rephrasing your question to be more specific. Include project names, dates, or specific terms that match your Google Sheets data.

**Q: I'm seeing an error about API limits**  
A: This happens when you've reached the usage limits for the AI models. Wait a few minutes before trying again or switch to the other model.

**Q: The data seems outdated**  
A: Click the refresh icon before asking your question to get the latest data from Google Sheets.

**Q: The chatbot is slow to respond**  
A: Complex questions analyzing large datasets may take longer. Try splitting your question into smaller parts.

**Q: I lost my chat history**  
A: Chat sessions are saved per user. Make sure you're logged in with the correct account and check the session dropdown.

## üîí Security

The application implements standard Django security practices:
- CSRF protection for all forms
- WebSocket authentication
- XSS protection
- Content-Type sniffing prevention
- X-Frame-Options set to DENY
- Google Sheets API used with limited-scope credentials

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production deployment, we recommend:
1. Using Daphne or Uvicorn behind a reverse proxy like Nginx
2. Enabling HTTPS for secure WebSocket connections (WSS)
3. Setting up Redis as the channel layer backend
4. Configuring proper database backends (PostgreSQL recommended)
5. Implementing regular backups of the database
6. Setting up monitoring for API usage and system performance
