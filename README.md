   ```
   
   Alternatively, use the Django development server (limited WebSocket support):
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

5. Access the application at http://localhost:8000

### Google Search API Setup

To enable the Google Search integration, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project** (or use your existing one):
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select your existing project

2. **Enable the Custom Search API**:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Custom Search API" and click on it
   - Click "Enable" to activate the API for your project

3. **Create API Credentials**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" and select "API Key"
   - Copy the generated API key

4. **Create a Programmable Search Engine**:
   - Go to [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/)
   - Click "Add" to create a new search engine
   - Name your search engine (e.g., "PM_ChatBot")
   - Select "Search the entire web" (recommended for general knowledge)
   - Toggle "SafeSearch" ON (recommended)
   - Toggle "Image search" OFF (unless you need image results)
   - Click "Create"
   - After creation, copy your Search Engine ID (a 16-digit code like "16b0e4815604a47f1")

5. **Add Credentials to Environment Variables**:
   - Open your `.env` file
   - Add or update the following variables:
     ```
     GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_copied_api_key_here
     GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_copied_search_engine_id_here
     ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=True
     ```

6. **Restart Your Application**:
   - Restart your Django server for the changes to take effect

7. **Test the Integration**:
   - Ask a question that requires current information like "What are the latest project management trends in 2025?"
   - The response should include web search results with source citations

**Important Notes**:
- The free tier of Google Custom Search API allows 100 queries per day
- After exceeding the free tier, you will be charged per query (check Google Cloud pricing)
- The system includes retry logic and rate limiting to help manage API usage

### Database Scaling

As your project grows, you can transition from SQLite to more robust database systems:

#### Migrating to PostgreSQL

1. Install PostgreSQL and necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install psycopg2-binary sqlalchemy
   ```

2. Create a PostgreSQL database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE pm_chatbot;
   CREATE USER pm_chatbot_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE pm_chatbot TO pm_chatbot_user;
   ```

3. Update your `.env` file:
   ```
   DB_TYPE=postgresql
   DB_NAME=pm_chatbot
   DB_USER=pm_chatbot_user
   DB_PASSWORD=secure_password
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   USE_SQL_DATABASE=True
   ```

4. Migrate your data:
   ```bash
   python manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > data_backup.json
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py loaddata data_backup.json
   ```

#### Migrating to MySQL

1. Install MySQL and necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install mysqlclient mysql-connector-python sqlalchemy
   ```

2. Create a MySQL database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE pm_chatbot CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   CREATE USER 'pm_chatbot_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pm_chatbot.* TO 'pm_chatbot_user'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

3. Update your `.env` file:
   ```
   DB_TYPE=mysql
   DB_NAME=pm_chatbot
   DB_USER=pm_chatbot_user
   DB_PASSWORD=secure_password
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   USE_SQL_DATABASE=True
   ```

4. Migrate your data following the same steps as for PostgreSQL.

#### Using SQL Database for Chatbot Queries

When scaling with a SQL database, you can activate the direct SQL querying feature:

1. Set `USE_SQL_DATABASE=True` in your `.env` file
2. The chatbot will now query your SQL database directly instead of Google Sheets
3. For optimal performance, ensure your database tables are properly indexed
4. Consider setting up read-only credentials for the chatbot to enhance security

#### Benefits of SQL Database Integration

- **Performance**: Handle millions of records with efficient queries
- **Complex Analysis**: Enable multi-table joins and complex aggregations
- **Data Integrity**: Leverage database constraints and relationships
- **Security**: Implement row-level security and user-based permissions
- **Scalability**: Support concurrent users and growing datasets
- **Real-time Updates**: Access the most current data instantly

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Q: The chatbot doesn't understand my question**  
A: Try rephrasing your question to be more specific. Include project names, dates, or specific terms that match your Google Sheets data.

**Q: I'm seeing an error about API limits**  
A: This happens when you've reached the usage limits for the AI models or Google Search API. Wait a few minutes before trying again or switch to the other model.

**Q: The data seems outdated**  
A: Click the refresh icon before asking your question to get the latest data from Google Sheets.

**Q: The web search isn't providing current information**  
A: Make sure your Google Search API is correctly configured in the .env file and that you haven't exceeded the daily quota (100 queries for free tier).

**Q: The chatbot mentions sources but doesn't include the full source information**  
A: Restart the application after configuring the Google Search API. This ensures the improved source citation format is applied.

**Q: How do I disable the web search feature?**  
A: Set `ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=False` in your .env file and restart the application.

**Q: The chatbot is slow to respond**  
A: Complex questions analyzing large datasets or requiring web searches may take longer. Try splitting your question into smaller parts.

**Q: I lost my chat history**  
A: Chat sessions are saved per user. Make sure you're logged in with the correct account and check the session dropdown.

**Q: How do I switch from Google Sheets to SQL database?**  
A: Update your `.env` file with the appropriate database credentials and set `USE_SQL_DATABASE=True`. Also, ensure your data is properly migrated to the database.

**Q: The chatbot doesn't understand my database schema**  
A: For complex database schemas, try providing more context in your questions by mentioning table names or key columns. You can also improve performance by ensuring proper indexing on frequently queried columns.

## üîí Security

The application implements standard Django security practices:
- CSRF protection for all forms
- WebSocket authentication
- XSS protection
- Content-Type sniffing prevention
- X-Frame-Options set to DENY
- Google Sheets API used with limited-scope credentials
- Google Search API with content filtering enabled
- SQL query sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Optional read-only database user for chatbot queries

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production deployment, we recommend:
1. Using Daphne or Uvicorn behind a reverse proxy like Nginx
2. Enabling HTTPS for secure WebSocket connections (WSS)
3. Setting up Redis as the channel layer backend
4. **Configuring Production Database**:
   - PostgreSQL or MySQL with connection pooling
   - Regular database backups and point-in-time recovery
   - Database replication for high availability
   - Proper indexing for optimized query performance
5. Implementing monitoring for API usage and system performance
6. Setting up a content delivery network (CDN) for static assets
